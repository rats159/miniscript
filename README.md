# Miniscript
based off the unfinished [syntax-sugar](https://github.com/rats159/syntax-sugar) language, but without type checking or anything. potentially for future use in a [one-day-game](https://github.com/rats159/one-day-games)

**Probably don't use this for anything real, it leaks lots of memory, and i reaaaaaaaaaally dont wanna write a garbage collector**
